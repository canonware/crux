The following files may be of interest to the user before/during installation:

* COPYING - Copyright and redistribution information.

* INSTALL - Installation information.

Once Crux is installed, run any of the following commands to print command line
usage for the included scripts:

  $ crux --help
  $ redpoint --help
  $ MrRogers --help

Browse the interactive help as shown:

  $ crux
  Crux, version: 1.0.1, threaded, PID: 2019, PRNG seed: 1359116404
  For Crux documentation, type: help(Crux)
  crux> help(Crux)
  [Top-level Crux documentation will display.]

Alternatively, access the help non-interactively:

  $ crux --doc=Crux.Mc3

There are some example scripts in the examples directory.  Note also that crux,
redpoint, and MrRogers are scripts, all of which may be useful for ideas when
writing custom Crux scripts.
