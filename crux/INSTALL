# Building and installation instructions for the Crux distribution.

################################################################################

Optional: Regenerating the configure script requires GNU autoconf and GNU
	  automake.

Building this distribution in many cases is as simple as typing the following
while in the root directory of the source tree:

	./configure
	make

To install, do the above, then type:

	make install

Cleanup targets include:

	clean
	distclean
	relclean

Optionally, pass any of the following (not a definitive list) arguments to
'configure':

--prefix=<install-root-dir>
	Set the base directory in which to install.  For example:
	
		./configure --prefix=/usr/local

	will cause files to be installed into /usr/local/bin, /usr/local/man,
	/usr/local/include, and /usr/local/share.

--enable-autogen
	Include dependency rules in the build system to automatically regenerate
	files created by configure when their sources are newer.  This is
	only of interest when making modifications to the source code.

Optionally, define environment variables when invoking configure, including (not
exclusively):

CFLAGS="?"
	Pass these flags to the compiler.  You probably shouldn't define this
	unless you know what you are doing.

CPPFLAGS="?"
	Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.  Note that CFLAGS is not passed
	to 'cpp' when 'configure' is looking for include files, so you must use 
	CPPFLAGS instead if you need to help 'configure' find header files.

LD_LIBRARY_PATH="?"
	'ld' uses this colon-separated list to find libraries.

LDFLAGS="?"
	Pass these flags when linking.

PATH="?"
	'configure' uses this to find programs.

Optionally, define cook variables when invoking cook, including (not
exclusively):

PREFIX="?"
	Use this as the installation prefix.

BINDIR="?"
	Use this as the installation prefix for programs.

DATADIR="?"
	Use this as the installation prefix for modules and documentation.

INCLUDEDIR="?"
	Use this as the installation prefix for header files.

MANDIR="?"
	Use this as the installation prefix for man pages.

CC="?"
	Use this to invoke the C compiler.

CFLAGS="?"
	Pass these flags to the compiler.

CPPFLAGS="?"
	Pass these flags to the C preprocessor.

LDFLAGS="?"
	Pass these flags when linking.

PATH="?"
	Use this to search for programs used during configuration and building.
